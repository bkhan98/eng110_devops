## DevOps
### Why, what and what are the benefits?
- DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
- It bridges the gap between Development and Operations. Help the company collaborate.
- It avoids blame culture which is why it came in existence.
- Give example of TDD for which you have a knowledge but operations might not.
- FASTER RELEASE OF SOFTWARE IS THE KEY BENEFIT OF DevOps

### Linux - Ubuntu distro
- any tool we use we must run it in admin
- 'vagrant up'
- 'vagrant destroy'
- 'vagrant halt' 
- 'vagrant reload'
- update 'sudo apt-get update' or 'sudo apt-get update -y'
- update 'sudo apt-get upgrade' or 'sudo apt-get upgrade -y'
- automation '-y'
- i.e. 'sudo apt-get update -y' or 'sudo apt-get update -y'
- Who am I 'uname' or 'uname -a'
- where am I 'pwd'
- how to check files/folders in existing location 'ls' or 'ls -a' shows all hiden files too
- how to create dir 'mkdir dir_name'
- navigate to any folder  > change dir 'cd folder_name'
- how to change back to home location or any location 'cd ..' or 'cd' enter
- how to create a file 'touch file_name' or 'nano file_name' also opens the file
- to see the content of the file on terminal 'cat file_name'
- how to copy file 'cp location_file_nam to destination_path'
    >create a folder called 'test' in 'current location'
    >cut & paste the file inside the test folder from current location 'move'.    
    >use this: 'mv file_name location_name'
- how to delete files/folder 'rm -rf folder_name'
- how to check running process in linux 'top', use control c to exit or 'ps aux'
- how to delete/kill/remove any process 'kill pid' 
  
  ### Permissions
  - how to check permissions 'll'
  - how to switch to 'root user' 'sudo su'
  - how to change permissions 'chmod instruction file_name
  - i.e. 'chmod 400 test.txt', test.txt is now only readable
